## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Web browser

or

* Linux or macOS or Windows
* Java 8+ Platform ([JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) for Linux and Windows or [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) for macOS)
* Bash for Windows (`git bash` should suffice)
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install my-crazy-module --save
```

Windows:

```sh
edit autoexec.bat
```
Say what the step will be End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


```
curl -s https://sourcerer.io/app/install | bash
```

To run wizard use `sourcerer` command for macOS and Linux, `java -jar sourcerer.jar` in folder `Users\user\.sourcerer` for Windows.

Use parameter `--help` for additional info.

### Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

A few motivating and useful examples of how your product can be used. Spice this up with code blocks and potentially more screenshots.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Wiki][wiki]._

### Running tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does. Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
.0.


### Release

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags).
